# BenchWallet
BenchWallet is a web, mobile and desktop-based wallet app that will be truly cross-platform. Currently,
we plan to support EOS, BitShares, Steem, Bitcoin, BitcoinCash, Ripple, Litecoin and Ethereum and plan on
adding more cryptocurrencies after the first initial launch.

BenchWallet will be available for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, Mac OSX and Web.

A current release date isn't scheduled at this time.
